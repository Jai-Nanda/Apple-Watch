  <h2 class="heading">We bring amazing people together to make amazing things happen.</h2>
  <p class="text">We’re a diverse collective of thinkers and doers, continuously reimagining our products and practices
    to help people do what they love in new ways. That innovation is inspired by a shared commitment to great work — and
    to each other. Because learning from the people here means we’re learning from the best.</p>

  <div class="another">
    <h2 class="heading2">Share an idea and watch it grow.</h2>
    <p class="text2">Every new product, service or feature we invent is the result of people working together to make
      each other’s ideas stronger. That happens here because every one of us strives towards a common goal — creating
      the best customer experiences. Just one example: the incredibly advanced camera features in every new iPhone are
      not the result of a few dozen people. They’re the product of hundreds of optical technology experts who complement
      each other’s thinking. Multiply that effort across every feature in every Apple product, and you’ll get an idea of
      how important collaboration is here.</p>
